# readme

This is a inspired project after I know mermaid-js. Used to keep a personal log of the time consumed on company projects

## idea

just following the [official way](http://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/usage) of creating a static html page for render

##  dev

the file path is: /public/views/index.html

## start project

```
cd express-generated
npm install 
npm start
```

## changes 

add `open` for instant open the target html page

## issues

need render html, disable express-generator view template 

## TODO


- there should be a index.html just display the thing
- should use npm for mermaid js
- should seperate data into another file
